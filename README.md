This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.16.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
